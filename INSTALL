Overview
========

The SCA_SDO package comprises a PECL extension, called sdo, that provides a 
Service Data Object (SDO) implementation and a set of php files that, together 
with SDO, provide a Service Component Architecture (SCA) implementation for PHP.

Generally you can install the latest version of the package using the command

pecl install SCA_SDO

The details vary depending on whether you are using Linux or Windows, see below.

Once installed there are a set of examples that you can use to try out SCA and
SDO. The location of the examples depend on where you have PHP installed but
generally you will find them in.

php_install_dir\PEAR\tests\SCA_SDO\examples - on windows
/usr/local/lib/php/tests/SCA_SDO/examples - on linux

If you copy this directory to the document directory (htdocs) of your web server
you can access most of the examples by pointing your browser at the 
examples/index.html file.

Linux installation steps
========================

You should be able to download and install SCA_SDO in one step as follows:

pear install SCA_SDO

(Depending on your php environment, you may need to be root to do this.)

Make sure that the module is loaded by PHP, by adding:

extension=sdo.so

to your php.ini file.

The PEAR installer will also install the SCA and Relational DAS php files into your 
PEAR directory.

If you cannot use the PEAR installer, you can download the extension and build
it manually:

pear download SCA_SDO          #downloads SCA_SDO-<version>.tgz
tar -xzf SCA_SDO-<version>.tgz
cd SCA_SDO-<version>
phpize
./configure
make 
make install               #you may need to be root for this step

To work with the very latest source, you'll need to extract it from cvs and
build manually as above.

If you have any problems, you are welcome to contact the maintainers.

Windows installation steps
==========================

The latest Windows binary for the sdo extension can
be downloaded to your extension directory from:

http://pecl4win.php.net/ext.php/php_sdo.dll

Make sure that the module is loaded by PHP, by adding:  

extension=php_sdo.dll

to your php.ini file.

To install the SCA and Relational DAS PHP files in your PEAR directory, use:

pecl install -B SCA_SDO

The -B option here cause the command to miss out the compile step. 

If you have any problems, you are welcome to contact the maintainers.
