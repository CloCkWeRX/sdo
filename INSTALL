Linux installation steps
========================

The sdo and sdo_das_xml extensions are supplied as a PECL module, which
you should be able to download and install in one step as follows:

pear install sdo

(Depending on your php environment, you may need to be root to do this.)

Make sure that these modules are loaded by PHP, by adding:

extension=sdo.so
extension=sdo_das_xml.so 

to your php.ini file, in that order.

The PEAR installer will also install the Relational DAS in your PEAR directory.

If you cannot use the PEAR installer, you can download the extension and build
it manually:

pear download sdo          #downloads sdo-<version>.tgz
tar -xzf sdo-<version>.tgz
cd sdo-<version>
phpize
./configure
make 
make install               #you may need to be root for this step

To work with the very latest source, you'll need to extract it from cvs and
build manually as above.

Windows installation steps
==========================

The latest Windows binaries for the sdo and sdo_das_xml extensions can
be downloaded to your extension directory from:

http://pecl4win.php.net/ext.php/php_sdo.dll
http://pecl4win.php.net/ext.php/php_sdo_das_xml.dll

Make sure that these modules are loaded by PHP, by adding:  

extension=php_sdo.dll
extension=php_sdo_das_xml.dll

to your php.ini file, in that order.

To install the Relational DAS in your PEAR directory, use:
pear install -B sdo
