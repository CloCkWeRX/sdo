Linux installation steps
========================

The sdo and sdo_das_xml extensions are supplied as a PECL module, which
you should be able to download and install in one step as follows:

pear install sdo 

(Depending on your php environment, you may need to be root to do this.)

Make sure that these modules are loaded by PHP, by adding  

extension=sdo.so
extension=sdo_das_xml.so 

to your php.ini file, in that order.

The PEAR installer will also install the Relational DAS in your PEAR directory.

If you cannot use the PEAR installer, you can download the extension and build
it manually:

pear download sdo
tar -xzf sdo-0.5.0.tgz
cd sdo-0.5.0
phpize
./configure
make 
make install               (you may need to be root for this step)

To work with the very latest source, you'll need to extract it from cvs and
build manually as above.

If you have any problems, you are welcome to contact the maintainers.

Windows installation steps
