Linux installation steps
========================

The sdo extension is supplied as a PECL module, which
you should be able to download and install in one step as follows:

pear install sdo

(Depending on your php environment, you may need to be root to do this.)

Make sure that the module is loaded by PHP, by adding:

extension=sdo.so

to your php.ini file.

The PEAR installer will also install the Relational DAS in your PEAR directory.

If you cannot use the PEAR installer, you can download the extension and build
it manually:

pear download sdo          #downloads sdo-<version>.tgz
tar -xzf sdo-<version>.tgz
cd sdo-<version>
phpize
./configure
make 
make install               #you may need to be root for this step

To work with the very latest source, you'll need to extract it from cvs and
build manually as above.

Windows installation steps
==========================

The latest Windows binary for the sdo extension can
be downloaded to your extension directory from:

http://pecl4win.php.net/ext.php/php_sdo.dll

Make sure that the module is loaded by PHP, by adding:  

extension=php_sdo.dll

to your php.ini file.

To install the Relational DAS in your PEAR directory, use:
pear install -B sdo
