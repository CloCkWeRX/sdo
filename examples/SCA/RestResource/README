Rest Resource Example
=====================

This example is based on the "order" object from the eServiceStore example.
Here we  provide a Rest Resource alternative to the OrderProcessingService
where orders for a given user can be created, modified and deleted using 
vanilla HTTP.

There are two parts to this example:

1. Orders.html can drive Orders.php directly using HTTP verbs, in the REST style. 
   See the section below for the mapping to HTTP
2. The restresource binding in SCA for PHP also allows one PHP script or component 
   to drive another, in the same way, using HTTP verbs. In this example, 
   OrdersClient.html drives the script OrdersClient.php which in turn drives 
   Orders.php using this binding. 

Orders Data Structure
=====================

Orders 1 ---- n Order 1 ---- n Item 
                 - OrderId      - ItemId
                 - Status       - Description
                 - CustId       - Price
                                - Quantity
                                - WharehouseId

Mapping To HTTP
===============

URL                                          Verb    Description
---------------------------------------      ------  -----------                   
http://???:??/???/Orders.php                 GET     Get the order collection
http://???:??/???/Orders.php                 POST    Create a new order
http://???:??/???/Orders.php/OrderId         GET     Get the order
http://???:??/???/Orders.php/OrderId         PUT     Update an order
http://???:??/???/Orders.php/OrderId         DELETE  Delete an order

All of these operations depend on the client having appropriate authorization
to perform the action. 

Databindings
============

Resources take the form of XML presented to the resource script as an SDO.
