<title>Service Component Architecture Examples</title>
<body>

<h2>Service Component Architecture Examples</h2>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Check that you have the SDO extension loaded - <a href="phpinfo.php">PHP Info</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<br/>
Extract the examples into the root of your Web server eg. C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs.  All the examples are contained in the examples directory, e.g. C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs\examples. 
A number of samples are provided, which illustrate different aspects of the Service Component Architecture.  For example, how to call SCA components from a PHP script or another SCA Component, how to expose SCA components as Web services, how to consume them as a Web service, and so on.

<h3>Local Binding - A script making a local call to an SCA Component</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="./Local/ScriptCallingLocalSCAComponent/HelloClient.php">ScriptCallingLocalSCAComponent</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HelloClient.php - PHP script: This script gets a proxy to the local SCA component (HelloService.php), and calls its sayHello() method, passing in the name 'Bertie'.<br/>
HelloService.php - local SCA component: This component implements one method, sayHello($name), which takes in a name and returns the string "Hello $name".
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Local Binding - An SCA Component making a local call to another SCA Component</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="./Local/SCAComponentCallingLocalSCAComponent/HelloClient.php">SCAComponentCallingLocalSCAComponent</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HelloClient.php - PHP script: This script gets a proxy to a local SCA Component (SurnameService.php), and calls its sayHello() method, passing in the name 'Bertie'.<br/>
SurnameService.php - local SCA component: This component implements one method sayHello($name) which takes in a name, adds the surname 'Beetle', and calls the sayHello() method on the local SCA component HelloService.php, passing in the new name.<br/>
HelloService.php - local SCA component: This component implements one method sayHello($name) which takes in a name and returns the string 'Hello $name'.
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Soap Binding -  A script making a remote (Web service) call to an SCA Component</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="./Soap/ScriptCallingRemoteSCAComponent/HelloClient.php">ScriptCallingRemoteSCAComponent</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HelloClient.php - PHP script: This script calls a remote SCA Component (HelloService.php) to cause it to generate its WSDL definition. It then gets a proxy to the remote SCA Component and calls its sayHello() method, passing in the name 'Freddie'.<br/>
Note: The default location used for calling the service is http://localhost/examples/SCA/Soap/ScriptCallingRemoteSCAComponent/*.php. Please edit this location in HelloClient.php to point to the correct location in your environment if necessary, for example to add a port number.<br/>
HelloService.php - remote SCA component: This component implements one method, sayHello($name), which takes in a name and returns the string 'Hello $name'.  It makes itself available as a Web service using the @binding.soap annotation.

Note: The default location used for calling the service is http://localhost/examples/SCA/Soap/SCAComponentCallingRemoteSCAComponent/*.php. Please edit this location in HelloClient.php to point to the correct location in your environment if necessary, for example to add a port number.<br/>
SurnameService.php - local SCA component: This component implements one method sayHello($name) which takes in a name, adds the surname 'Fish', and calls the sayHello() method on the remote SCA component HelloService.php, passing in the new name.<br/>
HelloService.php - remote SCA component: This component implements one method sayHello($name) which takes in a name and returns the string 'Hello $name'.

<h3>Soap Binding - A simple script making a remote (Web service) call to an SCA Component using data structures</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="./Soap/SCAComponentUsingDataStructures/HelloClient.php">SCAComponentUsingDataStructures</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HelloClient.php - PHP script: This script gets a proxy to the local SCA Component (SurnameService.php), and calls its sayHello() method, passing in a list of names.<br/>
Note: The default location used for calling the service is http://localhost/examples/SCA/Soap/SCAComponentUsingDataStructures/*.php. Please edit this location in HelloClient.php to point to the correct location in your environment if necessary, for example to add a port number.<br/>
BatchService.php - remote SCA component: This component implement one method sayHello($names) which takes in a Service Data Object containing a number of names, and returns a new Service Data Object of the same format containing the string 'Hello $name' for each name.<br/>
names.xsd - data structure schema: This file is a simple XML Schema containing one complex type, called 'people'. This contains a many-valued element called 'name' for holding the names of people.
