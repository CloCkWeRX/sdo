The ajax-rss scenario
=====================

This very simple scenario allows the user to step through the items of a 
specified RSS feed. In the process we show show how SDO can be used in AJAX type 
applications, i.e. applications that use features such as the Javascript
XMLHttpRequest to interact directly with a server without reloading the 
entire page in the web browser. 

The sample application shows a welcome page (welcome.php) that allows the
user to enter the url of an RSS feed. A "Get Item" button uses  
XMLHttpRequest to ask the server (sdoajax.php) to return the first item 
in the RSS feed. 

The server (sdoajax.php) uses SDO to read the RSS feed and to find the first item.
If there is an item the SDO representing the ite it is converted into JSON format 
and is returned to the browser. This JSON formatted notation is then shown in the 
browserand appears as the strange text you should see below the "Get Item" button.

Pressing the "Get Item" button again takes the JSON form of the RSS feed item
as displayed and passes it back to the server where it is converted back into 
an SDO and is compared against the RSS feed to find the next item
to display. 

This is a fairly useless application. It would be much better to show all the 
items at once. However it is contrived to allow us to show how SDOs can be converted
from and to JSON formatted messages and hence used to power an AJAX style 
application.
