Relational DAS Database Scenarios
=================================

The Relational DAS database scenarios exercise the SDO Relational DAS implementation
using a simple relational database. Scripts are provided to set up this database
in:
  DB2   - DAS\Relational\Scenarios\companydb_db2.sql
  MySQL - DAS\Relational\Scenarios\companydb_mysql.sql
  
Reading these files into the database is straighforward, for example, DB2 and 
MySQL comman line interfaces can be used as follows:

  db2 -tvf companydb_db2.sql
  mysql < companydb_mysql.sql
  
The database that is created consists of three tables:

  Company
  Department 
  Employee 
  
Foreign key rlationships connect Employee to Department and Departnment to Company. 
These result in and SDO data graph with containment relationships where a 
Company object holds Department objects and a where a Department object holds
Employee objects

The employee_of_the_month column in the Company table results in a non-containment
relationship between the Company data objcet and the Employee data object.

Once you have created the database in your RDBMS of choice you need to edit the 
file:

DAS\Relational\Scenarios\company_metadata.inc.php

Near the top you will find some constanst defined as follows:

define ('PDO_DSN','odbc:company');
define('DATABASE_USER','YOUR USERID');
define ('DATABASE_PASSWORD','YOUR PASSWORD HERE');

Uncomment either the DB2 version or the MySQL version and fill in the DSN, USER and 
PASSWORD information. 

There are numerous tests in this directory. The naming convention is as follows

  1cde-CRUDx.php 
  
Where
  1 = numer of rows involved [ 1 or m (many) ]
  c = company table is involved
  d = department table is involved
  e = employee table is involved
  -
  C = data is created
  R = data is retrieved
  U = data is updated
  D = data is deleted
  x = optional comment detailing further intention of the scenario
  
 Each test can be run simply be running the php script against a suitably configured
 (with the SDO and appropriate PDO extensions to support DB2 and/or MySQL) PHP 
 command line executable

You may like to run the Relational samples now which 
test the SDO Relational DAS against a real database. 
This does however involve some manual setup of a 
database first. You need to create a "company" database
in either DB2 or MySQL. DDL files are provided for creating
appropriate tables in the new database. See
 companydb_db2.sql for DB2
 companydb_mysql.sql for MySQL
Once done you need to edit the file 
DAS\Relational\Scenarios\company_metadata.inc.php
