Rest Resource Binding
=====================

The restresource binding provides a binding for accessing services that
map URLs to resources. A resource in SCA is passes back and forth as XML. 
There is though no restriction on how the service itself manages resources

HTTP Operation/URL/Resource Mapping
====================================

URL                                     Verb    Operation Request Content  Response Content
--------------------------------------- ------  --------- ---------------  ----------------
http://???:??/???/Script.php            GET     enumerate none             xml
http://???:??/???/Script.php            POST    create    xml              plain(ResourceURL)
http://???:??/???/Script.php/resourceid GET     retrieve  plain(ResourceId)xml
http://???:??/???/Script.php/resourceid PUT     update    xml              xml
http://???:??/???/Script.php/resourceid DELETE  delete    plain(ResourceId)none

POST with form content (x-www-form-urlencoded) is not supported. 

Service Function Template
=========================

The interface SCA_Bindings_restresource_ResourceTemplate.php provides a template
for services that wish to use binding.restresource. The service class doesn't have
to physically




Issues
======
1/ If the service class does explicitly implement the ResourceTemplate interface 
   then the statement 
    
   include 'SCA/SCA.php';
   
   must come at the bottom of the file as the class_exists function operates
   differently when your class implements an interface and this effects the 
   behaviour of SCA
   
2/ No queury parameters or user credentials are passed explicitly into the 
   service currently although they are available directly from PHP.
