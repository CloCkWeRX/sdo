The rest.rpc Binding
====================

This binding supports the rather poorly defined mechanism whereby server actions are
performed as a result of an HTTP request. The action performed does not necessarily relate 
to the verbs defined by HTTP and parameters for the action may be passes either in the 
URL (when GET is used) or in the body (when POST) is used.

In computing calling remote procedures with parameters has been called a Remote Procedure 
Call (hence rpc) and lately this has become a popular approach to implementing services 
in the REST oriented world of HTTP (hence rest.rpc).

In this binding the convention is that the name of the action to be performed is provided 
on the URL as path info directly following the name of the target php script. Parameters
for the action are provide as required by the verb used, i.e, 


GET /phpscripts/HelloWorld.php/someaction?parama=1&paramb=2 HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html etc.


POST /phpscripts/HelloWorld.php/someaction HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html etc.
parama=1&paramb=2

A POST request is expected to have a content-type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
or text/xml. The implication of this is that a method in a service is expected to have
zero or more simple typed parameters or zero or 1 SDO typed parameter. A GET 
request only provides simple types parameters.

Issues
======

1/ The wrapper allows any content to be returned but the proxy is only able to 
   deal with xml on the return
