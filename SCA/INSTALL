Prerequisites
=============

The minimum required version of PHP is 5.2, with the soap extension enabled.

SCA also requires the SDO extension version 1.0.4 or later.
See http://pecl.php.net/sdo for details.

If you just want to use local components, and do not wish to use the 
Web Service bindings, then this version of SCA for PHP will also run with 
PHP 5.1.6.


Installation
============

Normally SCA will be installed into your PEAR directory as part of the
install proces for the SCA_SDO package. Alternatively, you may check the
latest source out of CVS into some other directory.

Wherever you choose, you must ensure that PHP can access the SCA code, 
by setting the include_path property in your php.ini acordingly. 
Examples might be: 
  include_path=C:\php5\pear 
or
  include_path=/usr/local/lib/php/PEAR
  
Now you should be able to include SCA in your php script, using
  include "SCA/SCA.php";
