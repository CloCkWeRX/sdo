<title>SDO for PHP Demos</title>

<body>

<h1>SDO for PHP Demos</h1>
<table border="1" BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">
<tr>
<td>These programs were created to illustrate some of the concepts and capabilities
of the SDO for PHP extension.
<p>
They were intended to be as simple as possible, not to consider the issues of
security and integrity which a production program must handle.
<p>
Before using these examples you first need to create the sdo_contacts database
using <a href="./contacts/contactdb_mysql.sql">contactdb_mysql.sql</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>SDO API</h2>
This demonstrates the core SDO API.<br/>
It shows different ways to work with Data Objects, and that these are independent
of the data source.<br/>
<a href="./sdo-api/sdo_api.php?type=database">SDO API demo - database</a><br/>
<a href="./sdo-api/sdo_api.php?type=XML">SDO API demo - XML</a>

<h2>Contacts</h2>
This demonstrates the use of SDO and the Relational Data Access Service.<br/>
It can be used to demonstrate disconnected working, that is, you can work on
the SDO without needing to maintain a connection to the database.<br/>
To run: retrieve a contact, restart Apache, then update the contact.
The update completes without failure.
<P>
It can also be used to demonstrate optimistic locking, that is, simultaneous
access to the database is permitted, but a conflicting update is detected and
rolled back.<br/>
To run: open two browser windows, retrieve the same contact, update one of them,
then attempt to update the other.
The second attempt fails because the Relational DAS detects and reports the
collision.<br/>

<h2>Half-baked RSS</h2>
This demonstrates the use of SDO and the XML Data Access Service.<br/>
<a href="./rss-media/newitem.php">Create a blog entry</a><br/>
<a href="./rss-media/rss.php">View the RSS feed in your feedreader</a>

<h2>Letter</h2>
This demonstrates the use of SDO Sequenced types.<br/>
For more details, see the <a href="http://www.php.net/sdo#sdo.sample.sequence">Sequence documentation</a>.<br/>
<a href="./letter/letter.xsd">The letter schema</a>, showing a complex type with <i>mixed="true"</i>.<br/>
<a href="./letter/show_letter.php">Create the Letter</a>

<h2>Jungle</h2>
Simple example demonstrating the use of SDO Open types.<br/>
For more details, see the <a href="http://www.php.net/sdo-das-xml#AEN163901">Open type documentation</a>.<br/>
<a href="./jungle/jungle.xsd">The jungle schema</a>, showing an <i>&lt;any&gt;</i> element.<br/>
<a href="./jungle/populate_jungle.php">Populate the Jungle</a>

<h2>WSDL Generator</h2>
More complex example demonstrating the use of SDO Open types.<br/>
<i>To be added</i><br/>
<!--
<b>Current limitations:<br/>
no support for &lt;xs:list/&gt;, &lt;xs:group/&gt; and &lt;xs:attributeGroup/&gt;
